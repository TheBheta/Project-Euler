# Project-Euler
A collection of my Project Euler Solutions and Utilities.
Solutions are under module problems.
Utilities are under module util.
Numbers contains useful primality functions, factorizers, permutation thingies, and a lot more.
English contains a few English things, like letter ids.
Cards has nice enums for card suits and ranks, and a card class, with poker hand scoring.
I know these are the easy problems. I'm working on the rest.
